# Biralo: Beyond

**This is an extended and enhanced version of my original game-jam entry for JS13kGames 2025.**
<br>The theme: **"Black Cat"**

**A tribute to the fearless few who choose 'Hard Mode' first and never look back.**

Rebuilt from the ground up in **Godot 4.5x**, this version squashes bugs, sharpens mechanics, and answers the call of player feedback.
<br>I’ve packed in **new levels**, a **menacing boss**, and a bunch of other cool surprises to keep you on your toes.

I had an absolute blast crafting this beast and I hope you’ll have just as much fun surviving it.
